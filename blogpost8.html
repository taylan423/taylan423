Hey guys, this here is your classmate Taylan Ward and I want to give you guys a taste of my final project that I made for this class. I want to show you guys a bit of what I have and what will be going on in my final project. First, I am building a 2D platformer game just similar to the 2D platformer game Mario. However, there will be a character selection where you can choose from two characters. There will be monsters and bats that are trying to attack you when you are going through the level/obstacles. There will be three levels that you will have to complete to complete the game. The bats movements will go up and down the y axis while the monsters will be going right and left the x axis. The keyboard or the arrows and AWSD are your movements. You can also jump by using the spacebar. While you are moving the camera movement will follow until the end. You can achieve points by destroying monsters and completing the level. You will be able to see your time limit and your score on the top left of the screen. I hope you guys will enjoy this project and game that I built myself. Thank you guys for your support.
