  Jackbox is a very interesting game because the mechanics are based on either the players knowledge or what the chooser is really interested in. You can throw out many of your interesting sentences or ideas for a question but it doesn’t really matter if the chooser doesn’t like the sentence or if the answer isn’t qualified for the question. You can only accumulate points if the choosers are interested or if the question is close or right. That is the simple mechanics of the game. Usually a democratic vote of what was appropriate for the prompt.</p>

  Playing with the audience is a major impact and influence to the game because you are in need of the audience vote for you to accumulate points in the game. If you give the audience what they want to hear or see they will vote for your answer. It's basically a game of favoritism if you know what people’s interests are and what they laugh at. That is how I try to win the game to figure out what people like so I can keep using their humor or interest. Almost simple but hard because you need to figure it out quickly or you won’t do well in the game.
