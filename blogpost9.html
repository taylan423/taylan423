  When taking this course throughout this semester I learned more than I thought I knew about games and I am really big on video games. I really never looked deeply with video games, definitely the mechanics, aesthetics and dynamics of a video game. However, this wasnâ€™t the first time I ever coded or designed a video game but, this is the very first time I made a complex and harder game. Last game was just scenes being moved back and forth but, this one was a full on 2d platformer game just like Mario. I was very interested in the many topics that we went over in class. All of the different mechanics we learned from games, where they started from and how video games are what they are today. The material that we learned has given me a better understanding of games on another level where most people do not recognize all of the factors that take place to create a video game. Unfortunately, I see how some creators of games are not consistently recognized for their games either. It either feels like they are left out or no one really gives them credit. There are a lot of ups and downs about video games because sometimes video games can be great for learning and others can disturb the mind and body. Altogether, I want to say that this class was amazing and I had a great time being in this class.</p>
