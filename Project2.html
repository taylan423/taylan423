<p>
  For this project “Relief and Relaxation” it really isn't a relief video because of the noises. The background scenery is very relaxing and calm but the noises in the video are very annoying and distracting. I made these two videos to show how something that is very settled and relaxed can be destroyed by sudden noises. This project was supposed to show contrasting videos and sounds. I knew this video would irritate people because when you first look at it. It seems it would be just a calm video but then you realize it is just a bunch of distractions taking you away from that sudden calmness.
