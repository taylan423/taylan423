The project "Baseball" illustrates different baseball players that play and played in the MLB. I made this project because I grew up playing baseball and I have a strong connection to it as well. I've been playing baseball since I was a youngling till the end of my senior year in high school. For this project, I don't really have a true reason why I chose these certain ball players but, I know that each of these ball players had shown unimaginable skill while they were playing in the MLB. Each of these players had the skill to carry their team to the play off and the World Series. I wouldn't say I would look up to each of these ball players but, lots of people out in the world would and I can understand why. The style that they play, how they represent themselves and how good they are. This is why I settled down to do this project.</p>
