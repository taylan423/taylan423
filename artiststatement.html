  Well hello, my name is Taylan Ward. I would like to elaborate to you guys my vision of becoming an artist. I don’t look at art as just art. I want to use it as a voice that others can possibly use for themselves as well. It is very hard for most people to voice up their opinions and their ambitions because either they are too afraid to do so or they are being hindered. I see art as an opportunity to help voice those opinions that can’t be heard. I want people to be able to express their ideas, goals and opinions. For me I want to further my knowledge in graphic designing, computer coding and video editing. Actually I started furthering my knowledge when I was a freshman in high school, they had opportunities in courses for Photoshop, Photography and Computer Coding. This is when I started to begin a passion in the love of creating digital art works. With the knowledge that I learned throughout my high school years,  I have created t-shirts, made videos for people on youtube and made graphic designs for my friends for their personal use. Still to this day I have lots of people asking me to do those specific things for them and I have an amazing time being able to help them voice their opinions either on shirts, videos or any type of graphics. I really want to be an asset for the people who need help in voicing their ideology to the world because everyone’s opinion matters. Even yours!
  Recently, I have been looking for many opportunities to even work and intern at Disney in Southern California. I really want to invest my time in Disney to understand their techniques in video production. Also, Disney is a great place for people to voice their opinions and ideas because you can see in most of the movies and shows that they create they are very expressive in understanding people’s ideas. Basically helping children or even adults understand that their voice can be heard. I feel like my capabilities not only in art are very strong and can help people see their full potential in life. As an artist, I still need to grow but, growing comes with time. I know that throughout the years of my life each and everyday I will become a stronger artist in my fields. I will potentially rise to the top and make sure that I will be known. I will have my voice heard and I will help others have their voice heard as well.
  In conclusion, I believe that everyone has the potential to succeed in art and make their voice heard. There is no such thing as a boundary in art because there are no boundaries in your mind. I believe everyone can be creative in different ways but, it is how you express them and acknowledge them. If you want your voice heard then let it be heard either through singing, music, graphic designing, computer coding, playing instruments or anything. Have fun and take pride in your art and yourself. I promise that you and I can make it to the top. Just believe! A quote that I will always typicall follow by is Muhammad Ali's famous saying "Float Like a Butterly and Sting Like a Bee".</p>
