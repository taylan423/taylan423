<h3> Artist Statement </h3>



<p>
Throughout all of these projects that I have been working throughout the years in Art 74 and Art 75 have really helped me become a stronger artist in all of my elements. I say this because all of these projects were very diverse and branched out to different arts other than arts that I regularly practice. It helped me understand each and every arts components and elements so, I can use those ideas to help enhance my work. There were so many components of art that I didn't realize until I went through these courses. I know for a fact that each and every day I was attending those course my capabilities were being shaped and defined. Making it easier for to elaborate and express my art vividly and fluidly. I honestly say that I still need to define and shape up my work but, in all it will take time because I know each and everyday I will keep improving and strive for the best to amaze everyone around me. I always go by this quote from Muhammad Ali - "Float Like A Butterfly and Sting Like a Bee". In my thought to this quote is to make sure your always ready so, you can strike for that opportunity. I am very happy and content with most of my work but, I know as an artist I should never be content. I should always have the mindset to improve and get better. Thank you for checking out my website. I hope you enjoy! </p>
