  When I was playing the Galeco car racing game, it did not feel like an arcade game because I was playing on my laptop. Usually this arcade game comes with the whole driver seat, the wheel and the movement of the car. It did not feel as fun as if I was playing it at the arcades. The atmosphere did not feel as exciting, so the game ended up being boring to me.. However, the positives of this game is how it runs so smoothly and how I do not have to pay to play the game. Also, playing this felt confusing and harder than using just the wheel for the game.  Also , another difference that I noticed when starting up this game is how long it took the game to start up. When playing the cabinet style, you can press certain keys to skip the intro and start playing the game. While on the laptop, it takes awhile for the game to start because you cannot skip the cinematics or intros of the game. Overall, the game is exactly the same game and the same layout as the game that is provided in the arcade cabinet style. I wish I had more time to go to the arcades because it really does bring back great memories. Definitely the ones when I go with my little brother and all of my cousins. Also, it is very interesting that they were able to recreate these games and put them on the browser. Even though we do not get the same experience as if we played in the arcades, it is still amazing to play it for free online. </p>
