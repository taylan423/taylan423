  When I was playing the Galeco car racing game, it did not feel like an arcade game because I was playing on my laptop. Usually this arcade game comes with the whole driver seat, the wheel and the movement of the car. It did not feel as fun as if I was playing it at the arcades. The atmosphere did not feel as exciting, so the game ended up being boring to me.. However, the positives of this game is how it runs so smoothly and how I do not have to pay to play the game. Also, playing this felt confusing and harder than using just the wheel for the game.  Also , another difference that I noticed when starting up this game is how long it took the game to start up. When playing the cabinet style, you can press certain keys to skip the intro and start playing the game. While on the laptop, it takes awhile for the game to start because you cannot skip the cinematics or intros of the game. Overall, the game is exactly the same game and the same layout as the game that is provided in the arcade cabinet style. I wish I had more time to go to the arcades because it really does bring back great memories. Definitely the ones when I go with my little brother and all of my cousins. Also, it is very interesting that they were able to recreate these games and put them on the browser. Even though we do not get the same experience as if we played in the arcades, it is still amazing to play it for free online. </p>

<p> Well I thought it was very interesting playing this particular game because I had never played this game in my life and I won the first time I ever played it. I felt like I played my cards right if you know what I mean. Basically, I played slow, quiet and steady. The reason why I did this was to get everyone thinking that I was not out to get them so, they would not try to go for me. While everyone was calling BS on eachother I observed and saw that they kept going back and forth at each other. This led me to be very unsuspicious for them. I also played one card at a time because I knew if I tried to put more than one down at a time they would all get suspicious of me. I was intrigued how my plan worked out. I thought they would know I was the most suspicious because I was not calling anyone out or talking the whole game. I feel like in most games the quiet ones are typically the underdogs and find a way to take the trophy home. I also paid very close attention to everyone. I knew who had BS cards and if it really came down for me to sneak in a BS I would do it at the last minute when they were down with only a couple of cards left. You can also tell by each and one of their voices if they were playing the wrong cards down. They will pretend like they did not know it was their turn or ask “which card was it again”. It sounded smart but I knew they weren't fooling me with their tactics. However, I enjoyed playing this game with my group. I had a great time and because I won!

The game that I built is a race to the finish game. In this game you will be provided a board that has a start to finish, a deck of cards, a spinner and player pieces to move. How to play this game is that one player spins the spinner and whatever player number it lands on that player goes and grabs a card from the deck. Whichever card they get from the deck will be the amount of spaces they can move. For example, Ace is 1 space move forward , 2 is 2 , 3 is 3 etc. Then you spin the spinner again and whatever number it lands on that player draws a card from the deck to move their spaces. It goes on and on. However there is a twist. If a player draws the same number or ( heart, spade, diamond and clover) card as the previous player the previous player will be sent back to the beginning of the board. If it happens twice to the same previous player that player will be forever eliminated from the game, so they cannot win at all. Those are the basic rules of the game.
Mechanics that are being used in this game are elimination, card cplay confliction, Grid movement, single loser game, sudden death ending, track movement, spin and move, race 
Play test 1:
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1
Taylan is number 1 and he draws and 8 spade, moves his piece 8 spaces forward
Gerardo spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 10 hearts, moves his piece 10 spaces forward
Taylan spins the spinner and it land on number 2, Gerardo draws a card and he gets 5 hearts, he moves his piece 5 spaces forward but it sends Taylan back to the beginning
Gerardo spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s Queen clover, Taylan moves his piece 12 spaces forward.
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s King Hearts, Taylan moves his piece 13 spaces forward.
Gerardo spins the spinner and it lands on number 1. Taylan draws a card and it’s 5 diamonds, he moves his piece 5 spaces forward.
Taylans spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Gerardo draws a card and it’s 7 hearts, he moves his piece 7 spaces forward.
Gerardo spins the spinner it lands on number 2, Gerardo draws a card and it’s 8 diamonds, Gerardo Wins because Taylan gets eliminated from the game.
Play test 2: I changed the rules that if you get the same (clover heart, spade, diamond) it doesn’t send you back and it doesn’t eliminate you at all.
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1
Taylan is number 1 and he draws and 9 spade, moves his piece 9 spaces forward
Steven spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Steven draws a card and it’s 2 hearts, moves his piece 2 spaces forward
Taylan spins the spinner and it land on number 2, Steven draws a card and he gets 3 spades, he moves his piece 3spaces forward but it sends T
Steven spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Steven draws a card and it’s 4 clover, Steven moves his piece 4 spaces forward.
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 4 Hearts, Taylan moves his piece 4 spaces forward but Steven goes back to the beginning
Steven spins the spinner and it lands on number 2. Steven  draws a card and it’s 3 clover, he moves his piece 3 spaces forward.
Taylans spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 3 hearts, he moves his piece 3 spaces forward. But wins because Steven gets eliminated from the game.
Even though that one rule was changed to make the game go longer and have more run time, it didn’t because Steven got eliminated pretty quickly because luckily drew the same number that Steven previously drew twice to get him eliminated so, Taylan can win.
Playtest 3: Another rule that was changed is that you will not get eliminated if you draw the same number or (spade, heart, diamond, clover) card. The only way to get eliminated or sent back if the previous person lands on the same grid as the other person.
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1
Taylan is number 1 and he draws and 5 hearts, moves his piece 5 spaces forward
Chris spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 5 spade, moves his piece 5 spaces forward
Taylan spins the spinner and it land on number 2, Chris draws a card and he gets 9 spades, he moves his piece 9 spaces forward 
Chris spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Chris draws a card and it’s 4 hearts, Chris moves his piece 4 spaces forward.
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Chris draws a card and it’s 7 spades, Chris moves his piece 7 spaces forward.
Chris spins the spinner and it lands on number 2. Chris  draws a card and it’s 3 clovers, he moves his piece 3 spaces forward.
Taylans spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 10 hearts, he moves his piece 10 spaces forward. 
Chris spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Chris  draws and 8 spade, moves his piece 8 spaces forward
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 2 spade, moves his piece 2 spaces forward
Chris spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and he gets Ace hearts, he moves his piece 1 space forward.
Chris spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s Queen clover, Taylan moves his piece 12 spaces forward.
Taylan Wins the game. He made it to the end!
The difference between playtest 2 and 3 is that we can see that the game went on for longer because it was more difficult for the person to get eliminated. In addition, the game went on for quite awhile that someone was able to reach the end of the game.
