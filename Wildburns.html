<h3> Title: Wild Burns </h3>

  In the project "Wild Burns", it is supposed to raise awareness about wildfires. I created this project during our great span of pandemics of the wildfires. I see that our state and country needs to be notified of these problems because these wildfires keep on repeatedly happening over and over again. This is why I created an illustration of a burnt tree with grayish smog all around it. The colors of the shade of green,red, and yellow is supposed to represent the fire burning the green plant away. I hope to create a website of my own to raise awareness about wildfires and figure out an optimistic way to ensure that wildfires will be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that you can find a way to help prevent wildfires from happening as well.
