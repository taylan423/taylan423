<h3> Title: Tree of Me </h3>

  In this project for project "Tree of Me" I designed this tree to show people who I am. There are two sides of the tree. Meaning there are two sides of me. One side of the tree is white and that side represents all of the positive things that I love and really cherish deeply about. That side will help guide me to my goals and will help me reach my full potential in life. The other side is black, gray and broken. That side represents things that I love to do but distracts me and takes me away from reaching my potential in life. Basically hindering me from reaching all of my goals that I want to achieve and dreamed for. This is why I designed this tree to show people the things that bring me up and the things that can bring me down. However, I will be able to overcome any obstacle that is in my path.
