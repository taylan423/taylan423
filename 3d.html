<p> What I did for my model was very simple and I wanted people to easily understand the idea behind it. It is a world full of bunnies that are being created from the sky to fight to their death. Whichever bunny is the last one standing is going to be the crown bunny of the hill. However, each and every minute a new bunny will respawn and try to take the crown from the recent victor. I find this project very amusing to me because I was really trying to have fun with it. This was my first 3d modeling exercise and I wanted to try something different. That is when I had the idea to do a full FFA "Free For All'' with bunnies. It was very different and very creative because who would expect adorable bunnies fighting to their death.

<h3> Title: Exploding Purple Pen </h3>

<p> For this project, first there was a 3d image of a purple pen. Until, I started manipulating all of the parts of the pen so, it can look like an explosion that happened from within the pen. It took me awhile to construct this because I had to really decide which parts of the pen I had to adjust. I also had to angle and adjust the broken parts very carefully to get that explosion scene. Something that I enjoyed in this project is how the explosion of the pen looks like atomic particles or molecules. The affect of the atomic particles and molecules really drives the effect of the explosion of the pen. </p>

<h3> Title: Sharpie </h3>

<p> In this project, I had constructed a 3d model of a Sharpie Pen. I did this by using an app to scan the Sharpie Pen. When I was done with scanning the pen it gave me an empty outline of the pen. I had to fill in the rest of the details. For example, I had to fill the color, and the sharpie signature on the pen. I feel like this was one of the easiest projects because it was more scanning than creating from scratch but, I tsill had lots of fun with this project as well. </p>
