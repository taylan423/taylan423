This project was created through the application of illustrator. This was my first time ever experiencing illustrator and learning the components of it. We had to make those distinctive yellowish and green shapes in our project, so I thought they would look amazing in a space/galaxy background. Those blobbish shapes look like a type of alien life form. I also believe that the colors of the yellowish green really fit well with the universe background. They honestly compliment each other. I called this my universe because this is what my galaxy or universe would look like if I ever create one. I hope I do! </p>
