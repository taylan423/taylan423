  Mechanics/Description of Game:
  <br>
The game that I built is a race to the finish game. In this game you will be provided a board that has a start to finish, a deck of cards, a spinner and player pieces to move. How to play this game is that one player spins the spinner and whatever player number it lands on that player goes and grabs a card from the deck. Whichever card they get from the deck will be the amount of spaces they can move. For example, Ace is 1 space move forward , 2 is 2 , 3 is 3 etc. Then you spin the spinner again and whatever number it lands on that player draws a card from the deck to move their spaces. It goes on and on. However there is a twist. If a player draws the same number or ( heart, spade, diamond and clover) card as the previous player the previous player will be sent back to the beginning of the board. If it happens twice to the same previous player that player will be forever eliminated from the game, so they cannot win at all. Those are the basic rules of the game.
Mechanics that are being used in this game are elimination, card cplay confliction, Grid movement, single loser game, sudden death ending, track movement, spin and move, race

  Play test 2: I changed the rules that if you get the same (clover heart, spade, diamond) it doesn’t send you back and it doesn’t eliminate you at all.
<br>
<br>
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1
<br>
Taylan is number 1 and he draws and 9 spade, moves his piece 9 spaces forward
<br>
Steven spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Steven draws a card and it’s 2 hearts, moves his piece 2 spaces forward
<br>
Taylan spins the spinner and it land on number 2, Steven draws a card and he gets 3 spades, he moves his piece 3spaces forward but it sends T
<br>
Steven spins the spinner and it lands on number 2, Steven draws a card and it’s 4 clover, Steven moves his piece 4 spaces forward.
<br>
Taylan spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 4 Hearts, Taylan moves his piece 4 spaces forward but Steven goes back to the beginning
<br>
Steven spins the spinner and it lands on number 2. Steven  draws a card and it’s 3 clover, he moves his piece 3 spaces forward.
<br>
Taylans spins the spinner and it lands on number 1, Taylan draws a card and it’s 3 hearts, he moves his piece 3 spaces forward. But wins because Steven gets eliminated from the game.
<br>
Even though that one rule was changed to make the game go longer and have more run time, it didn’t because Steven got eliminated pretty quickly because luckily drew the same number that Steven previously drew twice to get him eliminated so, Taylan can win.

Playtest 3: Another rule that was changed is that you will not get eliminated if you draw the same number or (spade, heart, diamond, clover) card. The only way to get eliminated or sent back if the previous person lands on the same grid as the other person.
