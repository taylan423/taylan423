<h3> Title: Hyping Things Up </h3>

<p>For my video project, I really just tried to have fun with it. I wanted it to be different and stick out from the others. I knew someone else wouldn't have the mind to make a hype or dancing video so, I said to myself "why not".I tried to make the video into a music video with humor in it. I didn't really want to tell a story.

Overall, I think the mood was supposed to be humor and very energetic. I wanted people to get up and start dancing with the music video and be themselves. Everyone likes dancing once in awhile. So why not try it </p>
