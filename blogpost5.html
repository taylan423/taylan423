The role of this game is being able to obtain the magic item or magic button to hit so, you can advance to the next level. You will be traveling through many levels and each of them will be more complicated as each level ypu will advance to. There is no boss level and there will be only 10 levels that yoiu can go through. This game isn't too difficult and it hspuld be fun for beginners that don't play that many computer games. gam erules are  very simple and easy to follow.

  1. Well the players that played my game were pretty confident and ready for the game at tasks. They were able to breeze through the levels pretty quickly with not that many glitches are hardships in the game. It felt like the players had fun while playing and they barely had any type of issues when playing. I believe thatI shouldv'e made the game more complex and I shoud added more obstacles to make the game a little bit more difficult.
  2. I honeslty believe that I should've made the game more difficult by adding extra obstacles and thing that will make you reset. I shouldv'e added more aesthics to the game to make it look better and less boring. Maybe add more sound effects to the game because there isn't too many sound effects that are ion the game. I wish I would've added more player features because the only things that you can do is move left and right, jump. I wish I couldv'e added more details and colors to the player than just a regular stick figure person. Detailing the obstacles would've been cooler because it is basic blocks and shapes that are being used.;

Process of the Game:
To me it took me along time because this was one of the first times actually making anothe rlevel game because this was super advance for me. What was difficult for me was creating a rest button and the areas to die in. Because I have to make sure that you don't die or reset in areas that your not suppose to. Another thing that I found trouble was being able to get the magic button to open up the new area to the level. Sometimes when I did it, it never correlated into opening the new door or the new area for me. I had fun making the new levels and the new complex levels. I thought that was pretty fun for me even though at times it was difficult to rethink of different complex levels. I wanted to spice it up but, not spice it up where it was going to be too hard for the player that is playing. The sound effects were extremely hard for me because it was hard to simumantouesly get the sound effect and whatever object to correlate with the sound. For example, death sound, finishing the level sound and etc.
