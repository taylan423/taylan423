<h2> Blog #2 </h2>

<p> Well I thought it was very interesting playing this particular game because I had never played this game in my life and I won the first time I ever played it. I felt like I played my cards right if you know what I mean. Basically, I played slow, quiet and steady. The reason why I did this was to get everyone thinking that I was not out to get them so, they would not try to go for me. While everyone was calling BS on eachother I observed and saw that they kept going back and forth at each other. This led me to be very unsuspicious for them. I also played one card at a time because I knew if I tried to put more than one down at a time they would all get suspicious of me. I was intrigued how my plan worked out. I thought they would know I was the most suspicious because I was not calling anyone out or talking the whole game. I feel like in most games the quiet ones are typically the underdogs and find a way to take the trophy home. I also paid very close attention to everyone. I knew who had BS cards and if it really came down for me to sneak in a BS I would do it at the last minute when they were down with only a couple of cards left. You can also tell by each and one of their voices if they were playing the wrong cards down. They will pretend like they did not know it was their turn or ask “which card was it again”. It sounded smart but I knew they weren't fooling me with their tactics. However, I enjoyed playing this game with my group. I had a great time and because I won! </p>
