  In the project "Feels Better",this was my first Art 75 video editing project. I believe that I did a really great job with this project because I really set the mood with the background music and the scenery. It really went hand to hand with each other. In this video, I really wanted to show people my daily life during quarantine. The things that I do and see everyday throughout this pandemic. Even though the pandemic was a bad occurrence but, I wanted to illustrate the positive stuff about quarantine. I felt like quarantine had helped me sit down and figure out who I truly am rather than me being distracted by going out everyday or always hanging out with friends. You realize lots of things when you are just by yourself in your own little world. You don't always have someone talking in your ear. You can finally just listen to yourself and your own thoughts. This can really help you figure out who you are and the things that you like to do. I hope this video has helped you understand that being quarantined with yourself is not always a bad thing. It can feel better.
